// property accepts it or the hold runs out. The availability engine already
// stops counting an expired hold the instant the clock passes it, so this
// timer is not what frees the bed — it is what tidies up after: the booking is
// cancelled, the audit trail says why, the bell says it happened, and the
// dates are pushed back open on the channels.
//
// Every minute, because the smallest window a property can set is an hour and
// a guest whose booking expired at 10:00 should not still see it listed as
// live at 10:45. It costs one indexed query against a column that is almost
// always empty.

// `runNightAudit` is the only thing that advances a property's business date,
// and it was reachable only through `POST /api/night-audit/run` — a button. Miss
// a few days and the date simply stops, silently, while the calendar carries on.
// Found seven days behind on a live installation, which is not a cosmetic drift:
//
//   · Check-in is refused outright. `checkIn` throws 409 `early_arrival` for any
//     arrival later than the business date, so a guest standing at the desk
//     today cannot be checked in at all.
//   · Room charges stop accruing and no-shows are never flagged, so revenue and
//     statistics quietly stop at the last date somebody rolled.
//   · Scheduled rate changes never fire. `runDueScheduledChanges` runs from the
//     night audit; a price set to change on a date the system never reaches is
//     never applied, and therefore never pushed to the channels either.
//
// The roll happens in the **property's** timezone, not the server's — a hostel
// in Asia/Colombo closes its day on Colombo's clock wherever this is hosted.
// Until the local time passes the roll hour the target stays on yesterday, so a
// day that is still trading is never closed early.
//
// It never forces. `preflight` blocks the audit on arrivals that were neither
// checked in nor cancelled, and that is a judgement for a person: forcing past
// it would write a day's accounts over unresolved bookings. Blocked properties
// raise a notification and are left exactly as they are.
