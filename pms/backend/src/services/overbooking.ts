// Overbooking detection and control.
//
// The arithmetic is trivial â€” rooms minus bookings. What is hard is that the
// count is right in two places at once and still wrong, because between Helio
// deciding a room is free and Booking.com being told it is not, somebody bought
// it. Each OTA sells from its own cached copy of availability; it does not ask
// the PMS at the moment of sale. There is no lock to hold across other
// companies' websites.
//
// So this module does the three things that *are* possible:
//
//   1. Detect all four kinds of overbooking, not just the obvious one.
//   2. Work out the likely cause, because the fix differs completely.
//   3. Shut the door the moment availability reaches zero, so the room that is
//      already gone cannot be raced for.
//
// See docs/overbooking-and-alerts.md for why each of those is shaped this way.
// â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
