// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The registration record: an identity document and a signature.
//
// Two rules govern everything in this file, and they pull in opposite
// directions on purpose.
//
//   1. **Keep it, because the property must be able to prove who stayed.**
//      A scanned passport and a signed registration are what a police check, a
//      chargeback dispute or a damage claim turn on. Losing them is a real
//      cost.
//
//   2. **Get rid of it, because holding it is a liability.** A passport scan is
//      sensitive personal data. Sri Lanka's Personal Data Protection Act, like
//      the GDPR it is modelled on, says it may not be kept longer than the
//      purpose needs. A folder of passport photographs going back five years is
//      not an archive, it is a breach waiting for somebody to find it.
//
// So: encrypted at rest with the same key as the channel credentials, held
// inside the database so it is covered by the backups that already run, and
// deleted automatically once the guest has departed and the retention window
// has passed. The default window is 90 days and it is a setting, because what
// a property is obliged to keep varies by country and none of it is our call.
//
// The bytes never leave in a list. Reading one document is a separate,
// deliberate request that is written to the audit trail, because "who looked at
// a guest's passport, and when" is a question worth being able to answer.
