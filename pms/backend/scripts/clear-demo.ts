// This deletes a whole property. So it is built to refuse rather than to
// destroy:
//
//   · It takes a backup first, always, even on a dry run of the real thing.
//   · It refuses any property that shows signs of real use — a booking made
//     from a channel, a real payment, a connected channel — unless you say
//     --force and mean it.
//   · It never touches users, so you do not lock yourself out.
//
// The demo is recognised by what `demo.ts` creates, not by a flag, because a
// property somebody has started using for real must not be deletable just
// because it was seeded from the demo.
